<!-- I know you'll see this Xavier, this could be the lore page. My idea is in
    the header to add a link to this page. That would be done by something
    along the lines of what I put in index.html, commented because... Yeah.-->

            (which will appear near the top) it will show more tabs as you
            progress, at minimum the ending, literally to be titled "ending.html" -->

    <p>You wake up in a foreign place and you don't know how you ended up there, after looking around you notice that your are completely ALONE. 
        So now knowing that there seems to be no escape you decide to pull out your camera and voice recorder
        you think logging your travel through this place might help revel a way out of were ever you are at 
        You start your jounery starting off your log stating that you some how ended up here but you dont know why
        As you are looking around you notice ancient glyphs around.</p>
